/*
Interface (implements) vs Sub-Class (extends)...

The distinction is that implements means that you're using the elements of a Java Interface in your
class, and extends means that you are creating a subclass of the class you are extending. You can
only extend one class in your new class, but you can implement as many interfaces as you would like.

Interface:  A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method
signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the
signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method. You can use interfaces in Java as a way
to achieve polymorphism.

Abstract:  Abstract classes are similar to interfaces.  You cannot instantiate them, and they may
contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes,
you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private
concrete methods.

Subclass: A Java subclass is a class which inherits a method or methods from a Java superclass.
A Java class may be either a subclass, a superclass, both, or neither!

Polymorphism:  Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use
of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.

ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.

public class AnimatedActor extends BaseActor { // Extends the BaseActor class.

    /*
    The main purpose of the AnimatedActor class involves managing a set of animations,
    and selecting the correct image from the active animation.  Active refers here
    to the animation currently being rendered.

    An Animation stores a list of TextureRegions representing an animated sequence,
    e.g. for running or jumping.  Each region of an Animation is called a key frame,
    multiple key frames make up the animation.

    A HashMap data structure will get used to store animations associated with actors.
    String objects will get used as keys, and Animation objects will be the associated
    values.  For example, in a top-view adventure game, the main character might have
    four animations named north, south, east, and west.

    Methods include:

    act:  Performs a time based positional update and (if NOT paused) updates the elapsed time value.
    copy:  Copies properties from the passed to the current AnimatedActor.
    cloneActor:  Returns an AnimatedActor with the same properties as the current.
    draw:  Updates and draws the image for the active animation using a key frame based on the
           elapsed time.
    getAnimationName:  Returns the key for the active Animation object in the hash map.
    pauseAnimation:  Pauses the animation.
    removeAfterSinglePass:  Sets up an action to remove the animation from the screen after a single display.
      Computes duration.
    removeAfterSinglePassAuto:  Sets up an action to remove the animation from the screen after a single
      display.  Uses pre-computed duration.
    setActiveAnimation:  Sets the active Animation (key and object) using the passed key.
    setAnimationFrame:  Sets the specified frame of the animation to display.
    setFrameCount:  Stores the number of frames in the animation.
    setFrameDuration:  Stores the duration between frames in the animation (in seconds).
    setFrameTiming:  Stores the frame timing information (count, duration, time for a full pass).
    startAnimation:  Starts the animation (from a paused state).
    storeAnimation:  Adds an Animation object to the hash map using the specified key.
