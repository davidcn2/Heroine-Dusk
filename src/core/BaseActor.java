/*
Interface (implements) vs Sub-Class (extends)...

The distinction is that implements means that you're using the elements of a Java Interface in your
class, and extends means that you are creating a subclass of the class you are extending. You can
only extend one class in your new class, but you can implement as many interfaces as you would like.

Interface:  A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method
signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the
signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method. You can use interfaces in Java as a way
to achieve polymorphism.

Abstract:  Abstract classes are similar to interfaces.  You cannot instantiate them, and they may
contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes,
you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private
concrete methods.

Subclass: A Java subclass is a class which inherits a method or methods from a Java superclass.
A Java class may be either a subclass, a superclass, both, or neither!

Polymorphism:  Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use
of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.

ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.

    /* The class extends the basic functionality of an Actor class in LibGDX.

    Methods include:

    act:  Overrides the parent / super class act method.  Calls the act method of the
          Actor (parent / super) class.  Updates Actor position based on time.
    cloneActor:  Returns a BaseActor with the same properties as the current.
    copy:  Copies properties from the passed to the current BaseActor.
    destroy:  Removes the BaseActor from its Stage and parent list (as necessary).
    draw:  Sets the tinting color of and draws the Actor.
    getBoundingPolygon:  Sets the position and rotation of the bounding polygon to that of the Actor.
    getBoundingRectangle:  Sets the properties of the bounding rectangle related to the texture region.
    getTintColor:  Gets the tint color of the Actor.
    moveToOrigin:  Centers a small within a larger rectangle, using the borders of the current and target BaseActor objects.
    overlaps:  Determines whether the bounding polygon for the passed Actor intersects (significantly)
               with that of the current.  Moves current Actor minimum amount to avoid intersection.
    setActorName:  Sets the Actor name to the passed value.
    setAdditionalDetails:  Performs additional operations for the constructor that would cause
                           overridable method call errors.
    setEllipseBoundary:  Sets the properties of the bounding polygon related to the texture region.
                         The polygon uses an ellipse with the dimensions of the texture region as
                         the drivers for the width and height.
    setOriginCenter:  Sets the origin of BaseActor to center of associated image, in order for rotations to appear correctly.
    setParentList:  Sets reference to an ArrayList to which the Actor has been added.
    setRandomTintColor:  Sets the tint color of the Actor to a random color.
    setRectangleBoundary:  Sets the properties of the bounding polygon related to the texture region.
                           The polygon uses a rectangle with the dimensions of the texture region as
                           the bounding polygon shape.
    setTexture:  Sets the properties of a texture.
    setTintColor:  Sets the tint color of the Actor.
    setTintColorToDefault:  Sets the tint color of the Actor to the default.
