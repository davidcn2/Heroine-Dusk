/*
Interface (implements) vs Sub-Class (extends)...

The distinction is that implements means that you're using the elements of a Java Interface in your
class, and extends means that you are creating a subclass of the class you are extending. You can
only extend one class in your new class, but you can implement as many interfaces as you would like.

Interface:  A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method
signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the
signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method. You can use interfaces in Java as a way
to achieve polymorphism.

Abstract:  Abstract classes are similar to interfaces.  You cannot instantiate them, and they may
contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes,
you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private
concrete methods.

Subclass: A Java subclass is a class which inherits a method or methods from a Java superclass.
A Java class may be either a subclass, a superclass, both, or neither!

Polymorphism:  Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use
of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.

ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.

// Implements Screen, InputProcessor, and ControllerListener interfaces from LibGDX.
public abstract class BaseScreen implements Screen, InputProcessor, ControllerListener

{

    /*
    The class uses the elements of the Screen, InputProcessor, and ControllerListener classes in LibGDX.

    Define the class as abstract so that subclasses (xyz extends BaseScreen) can implement methods in
    different ways.  The class gets defined as abstract, instead of an interface, since it provides
    code for some of its methods.  The reused methods in the current class must use the abstract
    modifier.

    Detailed class description:

    The class refactors common elements from subclasses to provide for reuse and eliminate redundancy.
    The class handles the following tasks, in common to all Screen-extending classes:

    1.  Provide a reference to the Game object that instantiated the current class.
    2.  Initialize the stage objects.
    3.  In the render method, call the act method of the stages, clear the screen, and then
        call the draw method of the stages.
    4.  Provide empty methods for all the Screen, InputProcessor, and ControllerListener interface methods.
    5.  Provide methods for pausing the game, resizing the window, center a label in a stage.

    The game-specific (sub)classes no longer need to deal with much of the infrastructure, such as
    declaring and initializing Game and Stage variables.  The subclasses must now contain only two
    methods:  create and update.  The update method in the current class contains much of the act
    methods for each stage and all of the code that actually performed rendering operations.

    Note:  The creation step occurs in the subclass.

    LibGDX methods for screen include:

    dispose:  The method should get called manually when exiting a screen.  Add logic to clear memory
    associated with certain LibGDX objects.  In LibGDX, some objects need to get disposed manually,
    as they are not managed by the garbage collector.  The dispose() method is supposed to dispose all
    of these objects -- to release their resources.
    Dispose of the following objects manually:  AssetManager, Bitmap, BitmapFont, BitmapFontCache,
    CameraGroupStrategy, DecalBatch, ETC1Data, FrameBuffer, Mesh, Model, ModelBatch, ParticleEffect,
    Pixmap, PixmapPacker, Shader, ShaderProgram, Shape, Skin, SpriteBatch, SpriteCache, Stage, Texture,
    TextureAtlas, TileAtlas, TileMapRenderer, com.badlogic.gdx.physics.box2d.World, and all bullet
    classes.
    hide:  Called when the screen is no longer the current one for a Game.
    pause:  Called when the Application is paused, usually when not active or visible.
    render:  Called when the screen should render itself.
    resize:  Adjusts the size of the Viewport objects of the stages whenever the window size changes.
             Whenever a resize event occurs, the viewport needs to be informed and updated.
    resume:  Called when the Application is resumed from a paused state, usually when it regains focus.
    show:  Called when the screen becomes the current one for a Game.

    LibGDX methods for InputProcessor include:

    keyDown:  Called when user presses a key.
    keyTyped:  Called when user types a key.
    keyUp:  Called when user releases a key.
    mouseMoved:  Called when the mouse moved without pressing any buttons.
    scrolled:  Called when the user scrolls the mouse wheel.
    touchDown:  Called when touching the screen or pressing a mouse button.
    toughDragged:  Called when dragging a finger or the mouse.
    touchUp:  Called when lifting a finger from the screen or releasing a mouse button.

    LibGDX methods for ControllerListener include:

    connected:  Called when the gamepad connects.
    disconnected:  Called when gamepad disconnects.
    xSliderMoved:  An x-slider on the controller moved.  The sliderCode is controller specific. The
                   com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.mapping package hosts slider constants for known controllers.
    ySliderMoved:  A y-slider on the controller moved.  The sliderCode is controller specific. The
                   com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.mapping package hosts slider constants for known controllers.
    accelerometerMoved:  An accelerometer value on the controller changed.  The accelerometerCode is controller
                         specific.  The com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.mapping package hosts slider constants for
                         known controllers.  The value is a Vector3 representing the acceleration on a 3-axis
                         accelerometer in m/s^2.
    povMoved:  A POV on the controller moved. The povCode is controller specific.  The
               com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.mapping package hosts POV constants for known controllers.
    axisMoved:  An axis on the controller moved.  The axisCode is controller specific.  The axis value is in the
                range [-1, 1].  The com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.mapping package hosts axes constants for known
                controllers.
                Represents the analog stick...
                Value will range from -1 to 1 depending the stick position -- left/right, up/down.
    buttonDown:  A button on the controller was pressed.  The buttonCode is controller specific.  The
	             com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.mapping package hosts button constants for known controllers.
    buttonUp:  A button on the controller was released.  The buttonCode is controller specific.  The
	           com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.mapping package hosts button constants for known controllers.

    Custom methods include:

    centerLabelUI:  Centers the label in the specified stage.
    isPaused:  Returns the pause state of the game (true or false).
    setPaused:  Sets the pause state of the game to the passed value.
    togglePaused:  Reverses the pause state of the game (true to false, false to true).
    update:  The abstract method (defined in the subclasses) occurs during the update phase (render method)
             and contains code related to game logic.
