/*
Interface (implements) vs Sub-Class (extends)...

The distinction is that implements means that you're using the elements of a Java Interface in your 
class, and extends means that you are creating a subclass of the class you are extending. You can 
only extend one class in your new class, but you can implement as many interfaces as you would like.

Interface:  A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method
signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the 
signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method. You can use interfaces in Java as a way
to achieve polymorphism.

Subclass: A Java subclass is a class which inherits a method or methods from a Java superclass.
A Java class may be either a subclass, a superclass, both, or neither!

Polymorphism:  Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use 
of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
